This repository is part of the [[https://www.evo-land.eu/][EVOLAND Horizon Europe]] project. It provides a User Defined Function to apply a Single Image Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network to Sentinel-2 Level 2A images, allowing to super-resolve bands B02, B03, B04, B05, B06; B06, B08, B8A, B11 and B12 bands  to 5 meters resolution. The network has been trained in the course of the project using the [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6514159][Sen2Venµs dataset]], complimented with B11 and B12 patches.
